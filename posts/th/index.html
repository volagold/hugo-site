For every 3x salary increase, there‚Äôs at least 10x increase in asset prices. Shareholders employ hard-working individuals, let them work their ass off to increase company value, then dump massive shares to the market and cash out tens of millions, while only paying their workers just the bare minimum for them to put food on the table and pay rents.\nIn the COVID period, Powell the fed intentionally printed massive amount of money, knowing that high inflation was inevitable. Wealth of Billionaires increased 50%-70% or even doubled, according to various estimates, while ordinary people suffered from shutdowns, layoffs, skyrocketing rents and grocery prices. It was a direct robbery to the working class.\nIn history, many social upheavals had their roots in inequality. I fear that the current trend is no longer sustainable. We are reaching a tipping point. What comes next may only be pains and instability.\n[03.14] Dishonesty prevails If someone tells you that he founds an AI company because he will unleash the potential of AI to cure diseases, advance medicine, improve lives‚Ä¶..blah blah, he is being dishonest. The only real reason he is founding an AI company is because ‚Äúoh lord I want to get rich‚Äù.\n[03.14] ‚ÄúWhat did you do last week‚Äù is an outright insult As long as one man‚Äôs decision can change the entire life paths of millions of others, we do not live in a truly democratic and equal society. In a truly equal society, no one should possess the power to subdue any other.\nI‚Äôll go so far as to say that in the future, labor relations will be completely different from now. The familiar model of employers hiring employees and employees working for employers will be over. In the abundance of AI and robots, human labors will be organized in an entirely new way.\n[03.14] Frenzy selloffs are often preceded by great euphorias. Everything is wave.\n[03.11] $AAPL | Apple is destroying human eyes Apple adjusts brightness of your iPhone OLED displays by switching the display on and off in front of your eyes at 480 times per second, a process called pulse width modulation (PWM).\nThis method sounds very unnatural and harmful, and indeed it will cause eye strains and headaches. Another example of developing technologies for the sake of profit rather than well-being. Plus, they intentionally run down old iPhones and iPads to force you to buy new ones. I encourage everyone to short $AAPL whenever possible.\n[03.03] DOGE, the bigger ambition Elon Musk always wanted absolute control. Control Tesla, control OpenAI, control Twitter. But as a businessman, he manuevered in political environments that he couldn‚Äôt control. In the early days of SpaceX and Tesla, deals from the Obama government were critical for the companies‚Äô survival. Not surprisingly, he supported the democrats. Just as he scrabbled to find evidence of Sam Altman denouncing Trump in ~2016 after the Stargate project infuriated him, during the very same period, Musk called Trump a ‚Äúcon-man‚Äù, ‚Äúone of the world‚Äôs best bullshitters ever‚Äù, ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs champion of bullshit‚Äù. His stance quickly shifted as it became increasingly evident that the democrats were incompetent and were likely to fail in the 2024 election.\nNow his chance finally came. He‚Äôs not volunteering in cutting government spending for free. By penetrating deep into the government, Musk is preparing himself to become the most powerful man in the world. This is insanely dangerous, as he maniacally ousted co-founders, enslaved his employees, silenced opinions, attacked competitors, while always claiming the opposite. Elon must be stopped at all cost or the world will be stirred into a hotpot of nightmare.\n[03.02] No people, no profit Elon Musk keeps talking about declining birth rates and the urgency for humans to have more babies, yet he never talked about the why part. He is silent over the cause of the problem. High cost of living, long working hours, and unhealthy lifestyles are pushing people to their limits. Essentially the capitalists are squeezing everything out of the working class. He doesn‚Äôt even care this issue for his own employees as they have to sacrifice their family time to work their ass off for him or they get fired.\nWhy does he fear a less population scenario? It‚Äôs simple: a shrinking market size for his Tesla and other products that he wants to sell to you and profit from. And the narrative of sending people to Mars would become even more of a nonsense, as the earth becomes less and less occupied.\n[03.02] Restore common sense The West was heading toward an authoritarian communism dystopia at ultra high speed before it was stopped by a massive US election victory. Trump and European right-wing leaders are literally saving the Western civilization from collapse.\nIt seems that as human civilization becomes advanced, people lose common sense, stop respecting nature and become astonishingly ignorant. Paper straws are terrible; and why do they mandate vaccine injection into everyone‚Äôs body without considering any long-term danger?\nEither the leftists are extremely evil, or they are outright incompetent, or both.\n[03.01] Zelenskyy wants his own safety guaranteed on the clash: ‚ë† no chance of security guarantee to Ukraine from Trump because that means putting the US on the very frontline with Russia for nothing. ‚ë° To Zelenskyy, the mineral deal is almost a dishonest prelude of partition. In the event of invasion, American workers can be retreated timely and safely, leaving him and his country at risk.\nThis is really a tough situation for Ukraine. Difficult to predict how it‚Äôll develop. But given the country‚Äôs weakness, Zelenskyy is likely to be compromised.\n[03.01] Elon Musk is an asshole He often touted himself as a hero for saving free speech in America by buying Twitter. Yet, there‚Äôs no single day of free speech on X.com. He has been arbitrarily banning accounts that angered him, and suppressing opinions that are unsettling to him. He is no different than a dictator.\nHis censorship practice described in his biography continues to today.\nWorse yet, especially from the vantage of making the site a haven for free speech, Musk arbitrarily suspended a handful of journalists‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúHe was doing the very things that he claimed to disdain about the previous overlords at Twitter,‚Äù\n‚Äî- ¬´Elon Musk¬ª by Walter Isaacson\nThere‚Äôs no free speech on any centralized platform where users don‚Äôt own the backend servers. Only by giving people the servers can we achieve true full speech.\n","wordCount":"1134","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-03-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-03-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Fei Li"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lifei.ai/posts/th/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"lifei.ai | AI blogs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lifei.ai/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://lifei.ai/ accesskey=h title="lifei.ai (Alt + H)"><img src=https://lifei.ai/f.png alt aria-label=logo height=40>lifei.ai</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://lifei.ai/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lifei.ai/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lifei.ai/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://lifei.ai/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://lifei.ai/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">üìå Thoughts</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-03-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 11, 2025</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Fei Li</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#growing-inequality-is-very-concerning>Growing inequality is very concerning</a></li><li><a href=#0314-dishonesty-prevails>[03.14] Dishonesty prevails</a></li><li><a href=#0314-what-did-you-do-last-week-is-an-outright-insult>[03.14] &ldquo;What did you do last week&rdquo; is an outright insult</a></li><li><a href=#0314-frenzy-selloffs-are-often-preceded-by-great-euphorias>[03.14] Frenzy selloffs are often preceded by great euphorias.</a></li><li><a href=#0311-aapl--apple-is-destroying-human-eyes>[03.11] $AAPL | Apple is destroying human eyes</a></li><li><a href=#0303-doge-the-bigger-ambition>[03.03] DOGE, the bigger ambition</a></li><li><a href=#0302-no-people-no-profit>[03.02] No people, no profit</a></li><li><a href=#0302-restore-common-sense>[03.02] Restore common sense</a></li><li><a href=#0301-zelenskyy-wants-his-own-safety-guaranteed>[03.01] Zelenskyy wants his own safety guaranteed</a></li><li><a href=#0301-elon-musk-is-an-asshole>[03.01] Elon Musk is an asshole</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h3 id=growing-inequality-is-very-concerning>Growing inequality is very concerning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#growing-inequality-is-very-concerning>#</a></h3><p>Wealth inequality is going to the extreme.
